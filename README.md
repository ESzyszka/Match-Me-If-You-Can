## 🧠 What is this?

**Match-Me-If-You-Can** is a satirical puzzle game inspired by *Catch Me If You Can*, reimagined in the world of large language models. Horizon Alpha and Beta are rogue models on the run — and GPT-5 is hot on their token trail.

In this web game, you match fugitive decappers (Horizon models) with detective decoders (GPT-5 instances) before they vanish into a loop of hallucinations and fine-tuned delusions.
